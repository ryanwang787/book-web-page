                In How to Rob a Child, the authour presents an erratic and borderline chaotic recounting of their life, diving headfirst into tales of lost lunch money, questionable humour, and what might generously be called “self-discovery.” The book promises to be a memoir but often veers into tirades about the unfairness of the world, the audacity of youth, and random philosophical musings that don't entirely connect. Readers will be taken on a journey through the author's past encounters with humans aged 12 or younger, peppered with crippling depression and a touch of stiffling hemorrhoids that will leave you wondering if this is Diddy's long lost cousin.<br>
                <br>
                The middle of the book meanders, as the authour attempts to connect the dots between their troubled childhood and their adult quirks, some of which are deeply concerning. There's a chapter on “forgiveness” that feels less like reflection and more like a shopping list of all the things they plan to rob off tomorrow's youth. A sudden pivot into self-help advice in the last third of the book feels unearned and nonconsensual, as the authour confidently offers wisdom that is as legally dubious as OJ's trial. It's unclear whether this is intentional irony or a sincere plea for help that has gone unheard.<br>
                <br>
                At its core, How to Rob a Child is a perplexing read that hovers somewhere between tragic confessional and unmedicated schizophrenia. It has moments of genuine insight but also lengthy passages where the authour seems to forget what they say can and will be used against them in a court of law. While it won't win any literary awards, it's undeniably forgetable - one should only read this if they wish for their final 2 braincells to fight for the last spot. Proceed with caution, or curiosity, or maybe both, and donations are appreciated.
